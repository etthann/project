# project

It's work in progress as I know that the code is horrible and unmaintable. I am rewriting this in typescript and adding more features however there is a problem with DateTimePicker


Personal Project because I was bored and I wanted to make something for my girlfriend, it's an app for couples, it's work in progress and it's made with react native with Expo JS for frontend, backend and firebase for storage and authentication. It's not regular javascript, it's babel javascript. There are many bugs but I don't care 😎😎😎 took me 6 months, as I lost all my progress by messing around with git and git aborting all my code 😢









 I'M FINALLY FREE 😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
